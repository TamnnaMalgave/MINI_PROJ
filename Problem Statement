A customer logs into the RM Milk Suppliers app, browses products, adds items to the cart, and
chooses a payment method. After confirming the order, they receive a notification with the order
details. The customer visits the store to pick up their order at their convenience.
Scenario 2: Provider Order Management
The provider logs into the app, views inventory, processes orders, and prepares them for customer
pickup. They can automatically generate and send invoices. The provider updates order statuses in
real-time to ensure efficient management and customer satisfaction.

3. Functional Requirements
